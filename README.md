This project is a simple turn based rpg game with a unique twist.
Although a player character has 5 moves, only 2 of them are provided as options at a time.
The moveset of the player is stored as a circular doubly linked list, and the moves that can be used are the "move node"'s previous and next nodes.
This means that the player will have to think ahead; their actions determine their next options.

To run the game, please run the gameRunner.java file.
